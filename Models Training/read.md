## Models training 

Three models are trained through which we will choose the best model to use for our application which are:

 ✅ **Xception** 
 ✅ **InceptionV3** 
 ✅ **DenseNet121**

The transfer learning is applied and the convolutional layers only kept in each model.The best model is used based on the best performance of the model seen from accuracy score of the validation data for each trained model by using checkpointer to save best model.
